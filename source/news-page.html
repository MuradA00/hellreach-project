                Deep beneath the Obsidian Citadel from which Neltharion once defended the Dragon Isles lies a vast hidden laboratory where the Earth-Warder conducted experiments... forbidden practices he wanted to conceal from the other Aspects. Within these halls lies the shadow chamber from which Neltharion first communed with the Old Gods, walking a path that would one day lead to his transformation into Deathwing.

                While Raszageth has been defeated, the Primalists carry on in their bid to unravel all the Titans have wrought and must forge new alliances–or rekindle old ones. As the heroes of Azeroth pursue enemies into the dangers of Zaralek Cavern, they are aided by the local inhabitants found under the Dragon Isles — the molefolk known as Niffen and the Drogbar. They may not know much of the surface wars, but their knowledge of the underground is key to players and their allies finding their footing within.

                At the first of each month, players with an active account in good standing will receive 500 Trader’s Tender automatically every month from a chest called the Collector’s Cache. If you don’t have active game time on your account or aren’t a subscriber at the start of a new month, don’t worry. Your Tender will be awarded on the first day of the month when you do have game time or an active subscription. This will be the same amount for everyone, regardless of how you pay for your game time.
